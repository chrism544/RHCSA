400 - Configure local storage using partitions and logical volumes

The nmtui command is a text-based user interface (TUI) for the NetworkManager network management service. It allows you to manage your network connections, including creating and editing connections, viewing connection status, and troubleshooting network problems.

The nmtui command is a valuable tool for RHCSA candidates, as it allows you to manage your network connections without having to learn complex command-line commands.

Here are some examples of how to use the nmtui command:

    To list all of your network connections:

nmtui

    To edit a network connection:

nmtui edit <connection-name>

    To create a new network connection:

nmtui add

    To activate a network connection:

nmtui connect <connection-name>

    To disable a network connection:

nmtui disconnect <connection-name>

I hope this helps!
